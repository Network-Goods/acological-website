The IPFS Implementations Fund is driving the transformation of IPFS from reliance on a primary implementation to many implementations in order to meet the needs of a diverse environment of creators, developers and audiences utilizing IPFS beyond the current use cases. This fund will catalyze and accelerate the development of new IPFS implementations to serve new adoption channels, and ensure continuity for high impact teams working on current IPFS implementations to build and grow.
