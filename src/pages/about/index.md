The Association works as a decentralized Swis based funding vehicle for common/public good funders with the immediate step of building out efficient legal and operational infrastructure. Operational overhead support will allow for high impact/highly optimized allocation of funding to move quickly to projects who are working on public goods. 

Trust is key. We can turn researchers, developers, artists and founders into advocates by relationship-building, leveraging social graphs and expanding our community outside of the current feedback loops. Arocological builds relationships with key nodes (external web3 foundations and organizations like gitcoin, eth foundation, dot and others) and within these ecosystems we generate significant network effects beyond our own scope and ability. Thereâ€™s a huge opportunity for PL, IPFS & Filecoin to be *the name* when it comes to what protocol founders, researchers and creators use in web3. AA is focusing on scaling communities by scaling the public goods which they thrive on, educating and empowering them via transparency to make their best work using PLs technology.
