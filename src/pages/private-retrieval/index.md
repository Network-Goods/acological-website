The Private Retrieval Fund seeks to explore and develop viable mechanisms for reader-private communications (for application on libp2p, IPFS and beyond): we intend to fund both research leading to deployment-ready design sketches for private communication mechanisms as well as development activities implementing systems prototypes.

We are interested in funding projects which: 
- Explore new mechanisms for private communication (e.g. with cryptographic, information theoretic, or statistical bases)
- Relax the traditional ‘web’ assumptions of a single origin to engage with the possibilities of pre-distributed CDN or content-addressed data.
- Prototype the use of novel network-layer privacy technologies in real systems.
