The Arcological Association (AA) supports the regenerative growth of research, development and projects creating public goods in web3. We are building out the public good by creating the operational and financial infrastructure to massively accelerate promising new models of research, development and infrastructure. Arcological’s near-term focus is creating a new model for funding early and mid-stage web3 commons.

#### Why?

The overall goal of AA is to help projects/teams/ideas working on public goods and common problems really take off. Some haven’t even started working yet, and others have been in development for a year(s).  At whatever stage, AA's goal is to accelerate projects/teams by providing templates and provide expertise to develop operational pipelines, modeling funding structures and developing collaboratively new models for funding untraditional ROI models. 

Some of the mechanisms include but are not limited to:
- Establishing a pipeline of funding that can be applied for and explorable with a publicly transparent timeline 
- Technical support (full stack, including on-chain, UI/UX etc)
- DD on project, team, technical viability etc
- Legal/Marketing/Documentation/Tooling support 
- Evaluation of milestones and deliverables including release of payments, contracting requirements and signing 
- Establishing an understandable and efficient mechanism to apply for funding and make and indexable/searchable database of prior funded projects
- Once funding is offered, AA supports all  document signing & funds wired in a short SLA timeframe (in tax- and legally-compliant & efficient ways).
- Co-creation of retroactive impact evaluator.
